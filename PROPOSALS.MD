# Proposals

Proposals can be added for working groups for adding specific resources and implementation detail drafts. There should be a collective decision if a proposal were to be accepted.

## Structure

The structure of your files should be `docs/<working-group>/proposals/<proposal-name>`, You get your own directory to put your proposal assets in. Every proposal should have a `README.md`.
